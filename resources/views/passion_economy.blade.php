                                    The phrase “passion economy” was coined by Li Jin in the fall of 2019 with her blog

                                    emerging trend: the rise of online platforms allowing users to monetize their
                                    creative skills.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Not long after, Adam Davidson, a New Yorker staff writer and co-founder of NPR's
                                    Planet Money podcast, published his book: The Passion Economy - The new rules for

                                    In his book, Adam lays out the emergence of an economic paradigm offering new ways
                                    of making money, fresh paths toward professional fulfillment, and unprecedented
                                    opportunities for curious, ambitious individuals to combine the things they love
                                    with their careers.

                                    There are many others deeply interested in this economic paradigm and have spent the
                                    past year or so talking and writing about the complexities, subtleties, and
                                    disruptive potential the passion economy is comprised of.

                                    "For many people, whether by choice or necessity, participating in the gig economy
                                    presented real opportunities to make additional or fulltime earnings. But in recent
                                    times, a newer and, arguably, better monetization model has emerged. One that is not
                                    only suitable for the prevailing work from home conditions brought on by the
                                    pandemic, but helping people reach audiences all over the world while building
                                    sustainable businesses."

                                    challenging traditional social media giants. Instead of the generalised and
                                    non-specific content of larger social media platforms, the niche communities focus
                                    on creating and sharing content that resonates with individuals.”

                                    At Si Quis, we believe the passion economy offers opportunities for just about
                                    anyone to participate. Far different than the gig economy, not only are creators and
                                    freelancers finding new ways to monetize their skills or products, individuals are
                                    finding ways to monetize their interests, experiences, expertise and knowledge...
                                    the things they are passionate about.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Li Jin put it this way... "New integrated platforms empower entrepreneurs to
                                    monetize individuality and creativity. In the coming years, the passion economy will
                                    continue to grow. We envision a future in which the value of unique skills and
                                    knowledge can be unlocked, augmented, and surfaced to consumers."
